# SunsetGan

Trying stuff out with GAN, wanted to create visualization of latent space with a model trained from scratch but was not possible with img sizes past 64.
Trained a [DCGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf) model on sunset pictures gathered from Flickr and google images as [here](https://github.com/SamGalanakis/MakeYourBed).

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azohesyIxYE) shows the training progress of the generator while training on sunset pics at 64x64 size.
